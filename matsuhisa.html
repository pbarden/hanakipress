  <h2>Akira Matsuhisa</h2>
  <p>
    Born into a poor family in a developed capital, he lived happily until he was about 13 years old when he moved to Thailand.
    He became more important to society and was learning how to cook in new styles. With determination and some luck, he is trying to help others in a extraordinary world. But with his eagerness and powers, there's nothing to stop him from accomplish all goals. He began writing and teaching others soon after, sparking his passion for literature.
    He is currently enjoying the simpler life traveling throughout the Japanese countryside according to his Twitter followers votes. He feels like there's more watchful eyes than expected in this world. Luckily he has great companions at Hanaki Press to support him.<br>
