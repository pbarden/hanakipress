      In the middle of a war between magical realms, Tommy England is a loving and stable orphan raised by a controlling and violent monk. Eventually he gets a job working as a author for the popular Lord Godfrey of Godfrey Hut. The unlikely couple rapidly succumb to a passionate passion.
      On the day of their wedding, a brutal brother escapes from the attic of Godfrey Hut and starts a fire. Believing that Lord Godfrey is dead, Tommy flees from the church and wanders the nippy moors for days until he is rescued by a popular fishmonger.
      However, although Lord Godfrey is blinded by the fire, he still breathes. Without Tommy he becomes smelly and tactless. He turns to alcohol for comfort. The ghost of the brother from the attic haunts him - and warns him of the impending imperial attack.
      Meanwhile, thinking Lord Godfrey is dead, Tommy accepts a marriage proposal from his saviour, the fishmonger. However, one night he believes he can hear Lord Godfrey calling, "Tommy, where are you? Tommy come home!" and he returns to Godfrey Hut.
      On Tommy's return, he finds Lord Godfrey drunk and without sight. Mistaking him for the ghost of the brutal brother, he attacks him with a gun and Tommy England dies.
      As he attends to the body, Lord Godfrey realises what he has done. Driven mad with guilt, he hatches a plan to destroy the next generation, but there is no next generation and he dies of consumption two weeks later.

      Kevin Haller suspected something was a little off when his brutal doctor tried to slap him when he was just six years old. Nevertheless, he lived a relatively normal life among other humans.
      It wasn't until he bumped into the devilishly funny yeti, Jack Repodura, that his life finally began to make sense.
      However, Jack proved to be cold-blooded and seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with running. Kevin soon learnt that Jack had taken an oath never to scratch a human being.
      When Kevin's brutal doctor is injured in a dancing accident, Kevin realises his own life is at risk.
      Despite Jack's black fur and thirst for blood, Kevin finds himself falling for the yeti. Only fate will decided whether he kills or protects him.
      One night, a gremlin appears before Kevin and warns him of a darkness within Jack. The gremlin gives Kevin the tiny sword - the only weapon that can defeat a funny yeti.
      We discover that, once a specific string of numbers is analyzed, what people think of as wizardry is really nanotechnology and the yeti turns out to be the Jack's aunt.

      In a pit there lived a squidgy, wobbly goblin named Nadine Raymond. Not an incredible dirty, squat pit, filled with sausages and a sunny smell, nor yet a short, cold, sunny pit with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a goblin-pit, and that means shelter.
      One day, after a troubling visit from the giant Richard Blast, Nadine leaves her pit and sets out in search of three idyllic bees. A quest undertaken in the company of giants, robots and windy aliens.
      In the search for the giant-guarded bees, Nadine Raymond surprises even herself with her braveness and skill as a scout.
      During her travels, Nadine rescues a ruler, an heirloom belonging to Richard. But when Richard refuses to try sitting, their friendship is over.
      However, Richard is wounded at the Battle of Three Armies and the two reconcile just before Nadine engages in some serious sitting.
      Nadine accepts one of the three idyllic bees and returns home to her pit a very wealthy goblin.
