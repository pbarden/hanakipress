  <h1>Sukihiko Oyokami</h1>
  <p>
    She almost gave up her writing superpowers and was about to marry 'Mr. Right' at the young age of 13. With the support of great parents, she was able to come to terms with her sexual identity and live life as she desired. With her curiosity and determination, there's nothing to stop her from finding a way to the top.
    She got an important job as a social advocate and was strengthening the relationships with friends. Alongside great friends, she boomed in a fast changing world. But with her charm and brilliance, there's nothing to stop her from going beyond expectations. She quickly became popular when she began using writing as a way to express the many facets of our society and our interactions together.

      Whilst investigating the death of a local navigator, a noble actor called Felicity Wishmonger uncovers a legend about a cursed sandwich circulating around Los Angeles. As soon as anyone takes a bite from the sandwich, he or she has exactly 55 days left to live.
      The doomed few appear to be ordinary people during day to day life, but when photographed, they look translucent. A marked person feels like an ice-cube to the touch.
      Felicity gets hold of the sandwich, refusing to believe the superstition. A collage of images flash into her mind: a juggling kitten balancing on a frozen unicycle, an old newspaper headline about a safari accident, a hooded donkey ranting about spots and a drinking well located in a place that looks like a cartoon.
      When Felicity notices her fingernails have begun to frost, she realises that the curse of the sandwich is true and calls in her uncle, a paleontologist called Barry Thornton, to help.
      Barry examines the sandwich and willingly submits himself to the curse. He finds that equally strange visions flash before his eyes. He finds the juggling kitten particularly chilling. He joins the queue for a frosty, supernatural death.
      Felicity is crippled once she submits to the frost and Barry must pursue a quest to uncover the meaning of the visions alone, starting with a search for the hooded donkey. With Felicity trapped, will they be able to stop the curse before their time is up?

      Maureen Barker suspected something was a little off when her brave honey tried to peck her when she was just six years old. Nevertheless, she lived a relatively normal life among other humans.
      It wasn't until she bumped into the devilishly curvaceous kirin, Gary Doop, that her life finally began to make sense.
      However, Gary proved to be funny and seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with bopping. Maureen soon learnt that Gary had taken an oath never to scratch a human being.
      When Maureen's brave honey is injured in a drunk driving accident, Maureen realises her own life is at risk.
      Despite Gary's angry eyes and evil eyes, Maureen finds herself falling for the kirin. Only fate will decided whether he kills or protects her.
      One night, a oni appears before Maureen and warns her of a darkness within Gary. The oni gives Maureen the bendy rope - the only weapon that can defeat a curvaceous kirin.

      Suki Amano has the perfect life working as a teacher in the city and eating with her thoughtful girlfriend, Morwenna Russell.

      The night of the carol service changes everything for Roy Cox, a 55-year-old swordsman from Truro.
      One moment, he is discussing bacon with his giving sister, Alice Snozcumber; the next, watching with horror as proud witches eat each other.
      He knows these witches came from New York but he can't prove it - at least not without some backward trousers.
      The bold, modest man knows that his quiet life is over. He acquires some backward trousers and is reborn as the hero who will save the world from proud witches.
      However, the end of the world approaches, and time is running out for Roy. He is left with two options: stop the proud witches in one hour, or allow the world to end in a ball of fire.

      Whilst investigating the death of a local gardener, a brave psychiatrist called Brad Wu uncovers a legend about a supernaturally-cursed, silver map circulating throughout Ireland. As soon as anyone uses the map, he or she has exactly 70 days left to live.
      The doomed few appear to be ordinary people during day to day life, but when photographed, they look skeletal. A marked person feels like a moist hamster to touch.
      Brad gets hold of the map, refusing to believe the superstition. A collage of images flash into his mind: a simple elephant balancing on a giant gardener, an old newspaper headline about a bear baiting accident, a hooded lizard ranting about spots and a drinking well located in a magical place.
      When Brad notices his lips have hamster-like properties, he realises that the curse of the silver map is true and calls in his mother, a lawyer called Wenna Babbles, to help.
      Wenna examines the map and willingly submits herself to the curse. She finds that the same visions flash before his eyes. She finds the simple elephant balancing on a giant gardener particularly chilling. She joins the queue for a supernatural death.
      Brad and Wenna pursue a quest to uncover the meaning of the visions, starting with a search for the hooded lizard. Will they be able to stop the curse before their time is up?

      In a bungalow there lived a scheming, enchanted alien named Maud Walker. Not a frosty wobbly, snowy bungalow, filled with robots and a scheming smell, nor yet a noisy, backward, beautiful bungalow with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was an alien-bungalow, and that means happiness.
      One day, after a troubling visit from the ghost Chantal Blast, Maud leaves her bungalow and sets out in search of three beautiful coins. A quest undertaken in the company of fairies, goblins and snooty youths.
      In the search for the ghost-guarded coins, Maud Walker surprises even herself with her resourcefulness and skill as a lawyer.
      During her travels, Maud rescues a book, an heirloom belonging to Chantal. But when Chantal refuses to try skipping, their friendship is over.
      However, Chantal is wounded at the Battle of Britain and the two reconcile just before Maud engages in some serious skipping.
