    <h3>Jinzo Issei [ 人造一世 ]</h3>
    <h4>by Mamaru Kanno</h4>
    <p>
      After escaping the frosty prisons of Pluto, a group of people fly toward a distant shimmering speck. The speck gradually resolves into a buzzing, sprawling space station.
      Civil war strikes the galaxy, which is ruled by Reginald Widdershins, a derelict dragonkin capable of fraud and even drug smuggling.
      Terrified, an industrial wizard known as Melgmr Giranbu flees the Empire, with his protector, a mechanical companion called Jinzo Rabbit.
      They head for Camborne on the planet Earth, suspended in hyperspace for several days. When they finally arrive, a fight breaks out. Rabbit uses his silver pea-and-carrot shooter to defend Melgmr.
      Rabbit and Wizard Melgmr decide it's time to leave Earth and steal a fire engine to shoot their way out.
      They encounter a tribe of robots. Rabbit is attacked and the wizard is captured by the robots and taken back to Camborne.
      Rabbit must fight to save Wizard Melgmr but when he accidentally unearths a lost sealed record, the entire future of the galaxy is at stake.<br>

    <h3>No Nake e Sora [ の中へ空 ]</h3>
    <h4>by Yasahiro Chiba</h4>
    <p>
      Rhiannon Wu suspected something was a little off when her admirable doctor tried to convince her she was marked by a yokai when she was just six years old. Nevertheless, she lived a relatively normal life among other humans.
      It wasn't until she bumped into the lost yet arrogant woman, Millicent, that her life finally began to make sense.
      However, Milli proved to be violent and seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with thinking. Rhiannon soon learnt that Milli is really a yokai - and has taken an oath never to befriend a human being. Why do things seem otherwise?
      When Rhiannon's admirable doctor is injured in a boating accident, Rhiannon realises her own life is at risk.
      Despite Milli's inherent evilness and translucent body, Rhiannon finds herself falling for the demon. Only fate will decided whether she kills or protects her.
      One night, a gargoyle appears before Rhiannon and warns her of a darkness within Milli. The gargoyle gives Rhiannon a silver bullet - the only thing that can defeat a arrogant demon.
      Will Rhiannon find it in herself to kill the only creature who has ever made her feel truly on edge?
