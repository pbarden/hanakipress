    <h2>We Are Five.</h2>
    <p>
     Hanaki Press ( JP:はなきプレス <i>Hanaki Puresu</i> ) got started like many companies do - in a basement. Two young, aspiring authors who attended a university together noticed they had something in common - a burning desire to bring themes of foreign literature to worldwide audiences. Hanaki Press has since fostered relationships with several authors, helping to bring other aspiring authors the tools to help make them successful. Some of those services include editing, design, formatting, and various small business needs.

      <h4>Yasahiro Chiba</h4>
      <p>
        He's honest, witty, eager and perhaps a little eccentric. But what'd you expect from somebody with his position.
        He was born in a royal family in a major capital. He lived in peace until he was about 15 years old, when he graduated from university and began his journey as a writer.
        He gained new responsibilities and was forced to grow up fast. With a great deal of determination, he succeeded in a weird world. But with his persistence and eagerness, there's nothing to stop him from staying ahead of the game. He could quickly become a friend you'd want by your side.
        Despite all this success, he is currently still learning, exploring and discovering. He feels like there's more to enjoy in this world. Luckily he has great companions to support him. Chiba currently resides in Kenritsu-Yomei in Urasoe prefecture, Okinawa and shares his passion for literature as a substitute school teacher during his spare time.

      <h4>Naota Watanabe</h4>
      <p>
        He lost his arms after a terrible disaster and was caught up with the wrong people. Alongside a cousin he had to survive in a rough world. But with his skills and inginuity, he managed to overcome all odds and battle the elements. At 21, he got his arms back when Wanakami Robotics donated a pair of 3D-printed fully-functional arms.
        Still affected by the past, he now works as a travelling pen for hire, exposing both injustice and unexpected love in creative ways. By doing so, he hopes to leave the past behind and finally share joy and love for life he has found.

      <h4>Sukihiko Oyokami</h4>
      <p>
        She almost gave up her writing superpowers and was about to marry 'Mr. Right' at the young age of 13. With the support of great parents, she was able to come to terms with her sexual identity and live life as she desired. With her curiosity and determination, there's nothing to stop her from finding a way to the top.
        She got an important job as a social advocate and was strengthening the relationships with friends. Alongside great friends, she boomed in a fast changing world. But with her charm and brilliance, there's nothing to stop her from going beyond expectations. She quickly became popular when she began using writing as a way to express the many facets of our society and our interactions together.

      <h4>Mamaru Kanno</h4>
      <p>
        She's skillful, witty and petulant. But this is all just a facade, a mechanism to deal with her shocking past.
        She was born and grew up in a loving family in an important town, she lived in peace until she was about 9 years old, but at that point life took a turn for the worst when her parents died. She then wrote and published her first novel one year later, the youngest author to ever reach the best-sellers lists across Japan.
        She got her revenge during the great drought by hacking systems and shutting down trade across an entire country for almost 4 months. She was then imprisoned and alone in a foreign country for several years. Together with a companion she had to survive in a bitter world. But with her fighting skills and intrepidness, she managed to overcome all odds and keep ahead of the curve. This has turned her into the woman she is today.
        While constantly travelling the world, she now works tracking the people of the past. By doing so, she hopes to find a place to call home and finally find tranquility she has never had. Her stories continue to touch millions.

      <h4>Akira Matsuhisa</h4>
      <p>
        Born into a poor family in a developed capital, he lived happily until he was about 13 years old when he moved to Thailand.
        He became more important to society and was learning how to cook in new styles. With determination and some luck, he is trying to help others in a extraordinary world. But with his eagerness and powers, there's nothing to stop him from accomplish all goals. He began writing and teaching others soon after, sparking his passion for literature.
        He is currently enjoying the simpler life traveling throughout the Japanese countryside according to his Twitter followers votes. He feels like there's more watchful eyes than expected in this world. Luckily he has great companions at Hanaki Press to support him.<br>
