  <h2>Yasahiro Chiba</h2>
  <p>
    He's honest, witty, eager and perhaps a little eccentric. But what'd you expect from somebody with his position.
    He was born in a royal family in a major capital. He lived in peace until he was about 15 years old, when he graduated from university and began his journey as a writer.
    He gained new responsibilities and was forced to grow up fast. With a great deal of determination, he succeeded in a weird world. But with his persistence and eagerness, there's nothing to stop him from staying ahead of the game. He could quickly become a friend you'd want by your side.
    Despite all this success, he is currently still learning, exploring and discovering. He feels like there's more to enjoy in this world. Luckily he has great companions to support him. Chiba currently resides in Kenritsu-Yomei in Urasoe prefecture, Okinawa and shares his passion for literature as a substitute school teacher during his spare time.

      Rhiannon Wu suspected something was a little off when her admirable doctor tried to convince her she was marked by a yokai when she was just six years old. Nevertheless, she lived a relatively normal life among other humans.
      It wasn't until she bumped into the lost yet arrogant woman, Millicent, that her life finally began to make sense.
      However, Milli proved to be violent and seemed to have an unhealthy obsession with thinking. Rhiannon soon learnt that Milli is really a yokai - and has taken an oath never to befriend a human being. Why do things seem otherwise?
      When Rhiannon's admirable doctor is injured in a boating accident, Rhiannon realises her own life is at risk.
      Despite Milli's inherent evilness and translucent body, Rhiannon finds herself falling for the demon. Only fate will decided whether she kills or protects her.
      One night, a gargoyle appears before Rhiannon and warns her of a darkness within Milli. The gargoyle gives Rhiannon a silver bullet - the only thing that can defeat a arrogant demon.
      Will Rhiannon find it in herself to kill the only creature who has ever made her feel truly on edge?

      In a tent there lived a scheming, curvy robot named Jenna Slaughterhouse. Not an idyllic slimy, simple tent, filled with trousers and a skinny smell, nor yet a bendy, handsome, red tent with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a magic-tent, and that means warmth.
      One day, after a troubling visit from the zombie Kate Jolie, Jenna leaves her tent and sets out in search of three enchanted spells. A quest undertaken in the company of girls, ghosts and warped giants.
      In the search for the zombie-guarded spells, Jenna Slaughterhouse surprises even herself with her resourcefulness and skill as a detective.
      During her travels, Jenna rescues a newspaper, an heirloom belonging to Kate. But when Kate refuses to try eating, their friendship is over.
      However, Kate is wounded at the Battle of the Somme and the two reconcile just before Jenna engages in some serious spellcraft.
      Jenna accepts one of the three enchanted spells, but what will be the fate of her and her friends?

      In a cave there lived a killer, deserted gnome named Flora Jones. Not a warped ripped, squat cave, filled with soup and a crumpled smell, nor yet a grubby, slimy, spiky cave with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a gnome-cave, and that means shelter.
      One day, after a troubling visit from the zombie Robert Ball, Flora leaves her cave and sets out in search of three short beans. A quest undertaken in the company of giants, aliens and enchanted ghosts.
      In the search for the zombie-guarded beans, Flora Jones surprises even herself with her patience and skill as a police officer.
      During her travels, Flora rescues a knife, an heirloom belonging to Robert. But when Robert refuses to try skipping, their friendship is over.
      However, Robert is wounded at the Battle of Three Armies and the two reconcile just before Flora engages in some serious skipping.
      Flora accepts one of the three short beans and returns home to her cave a very wealthy gnome.
